            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a third-year student in the Rochester Institute of Technology's Game Design and Development program.
                In my time here at RIT I have learned about many different aspects of game design and development. I
                have learned about programming games mainly in Unity using C#, but also using C++ and JavaScript. I have
                learned about some of the art aspects of game development as well, with 2D and 3D animation and asset
                production.</p>
            <p>Outside of classes, I've been involved in a number of game jams, each time focusing on practicing a
                specific skill or tool. In this manner, I've been able to learn another game engine, Godot, as well as
                been able to improve my game art skills. </p>

                        Spring 2024<br><br>
                        Created by four person team Overwhelmingly Negative as our first project together for a
                        class.<br><br>
                        As a semester long project, we were required to create a game using Monogame that fit the theme
                        of "just a stick". We decided to follow this theme by creating a game that could theoretically
                        be played using just a joystick. We created an autoshooter in which the player has to survive
                        waves of squirrels attacking them by moving and avoiding them while the mage automatically
                        shoots at the nearest squirrel.<br><br>
                        With this being our first game we created, we did not split up our contibutions significantly.
                        Everyone worked a little bit on every part of the project, from finding assets to programming
                        the main elements of the game, I, as well as the rest of the group, was involved in it
                        all.<br><br>

                        Fall 2024<br><br>
                        Created by myself as a final project for a class.<br><br>
                        For a final project, using Pixijs and JavaScript, I created a game about stealing diamonds from
                        a museum while trying to avoid tripping any laser sensors. For this game, I created all of the
                        assets except for the font. I made the pixel art, animations, and created the sound effects
                        using jsfxr.<br><br>
                        For this project, we were also required to make a webpage including instructions, documentation,
                        credits, and the initial proposal for the project. I was able to create these pages thanks to
                        the HTML and CSS skills I learned in this class.<br><br>

                        <b>Class:</b> Game Design and Development II<br>
                        Fall 2025<br><br>
                        Created by team 5 Devs in a Trenchcoat<br><br>
                        As a semester long project, we created a game about avoiding a light-seeking monster while
                        trying to escape a factory. Created in Unity 3D, we had a big focus on the lighting and
                        atmosphere of our game, as well as making a monster that felt scary without being too
                        strong. The player is given multiple options for avoiding the killer, like toggling their
                        flashlight, throwing flares, or using other lights in the environment, as well as the
                        ability to find keys to unlock doors, opening more areas for the player to explore.<br><br>
                        This class had a major focus on being as similar to a real-world game development as
                        possible. We each had roles on our team, used Jira to help manage our project, and organized
                        our work progress into multiple sprints over the course of the semester. I was one of two
                        main programmers on the team, working across many aspects of our game like player and camera
                        movement, interactable items like flares, keys, and doors, as well as the UI elements of our
                        game, like the HUD, pausing, and all the different screens the player might see. My biggest
                        contribution, and the one I am most proud of, is the monster AI. I created the monster and
                        programmed all of its behaviors, having it react to lights, searching for the player, and
                        having multiple different behavior states that it transitions through depending on the
                        environment surrounding it.<br><br>

                        RIT X Granola.gg Game Jam<br>
                        October 2024<br><br>
                        Created by team Overwhelmingly Negative for our first ever game jam.<br><br>
                        As our first game jam, we had less than 48 hours to make a game fitting the theme "nostalgia".
                        We decided to follow this theme by creating a game similar to another game from the 80s called
                        <i>Contra</i>. The game followed an 80s action hero named "John Dude" as he gets relocated into
                        the medieval times with his machine gun and has to defend against the people of the time who
                        hunt him down for witchcraft.<br><br>
                        Because this was our first game jam, we were somewhat disorganized and did not focus on specific
                        roles. Each member of the group worked on all parts of the game, from designing it to
                        programming it. This project taught us a lot about developing games, especially under tough time
                        pressure.<br><br>

                        RIT Game Developers Club x Drawing Club Spring 2025 Game Jam<br>
                        March 2025<br><br>
                        Created alongside Jefferson Goehring from team Overwhelmingly Negative.<br><br>
                        For this jam, we were given less than 48 hours to make a game fitting the theme "crush". Our
                        game, Antageddon, follows a man trying to defend his food from an ant infestation. The player
                        must drag around foods while clicking on ants to crush them.<br><br>
                        Since this jam was done only as a partnership, both Jeff and I worked on programming together.
                        He had more of a focus on the programming, however, while I worked on some programming as well
                        as finding our assets<br><br>

                        October 2025<br><br>
                        Created by team Overwhelmingly Negative.<br><br>
                        For this game jam, we were given the theme "shared possesion" and less than 48 hours to make a
                        game following that theme. For "shared possession", we created a game where you play as a man
                        who must fight for control of his brain from a parasite. The player has to collect enough money
                        to enter the hospital and get the parasite removed, they can also pick up meds to slow down the
                        parasite's infection progress.<br><br>
                        This jam was the first that we created all of the assets for rather than finding assets online.
                        I was one of the two programmers, coding parts of the game like the obstacles, collectibles, and
                        more while also creating a number of the art assets like the main sprite animation,
                        collectibles, and other sprites.<br><br>

                        November 2025<br><br>
                        Created by my brother, David Poore, and I.<br><br>
                        Given the chance to roll multiple dice to determine what the criteria would be for our game, we
                        rolled the theme "time is a resource", the adventure genre, one button input type, and black and
                        white art style. To fit these criteria, we created a game in which the player must launch
                        themselves as a wrecking ball into buildings and obstacles to try to destroy them within a
                        certain time limit. The space bar is the only button used throughout the game, even for
                        navigating menus.<br><br>
                        For this jam, both of us split up the work pretty evenly, him focusing on the player controlling
                        and level design and me focusing on obstacles, menu navigation, and art. For this jam, we once
                        again did all of the asset production which I drew all of the art for.<br><br>
